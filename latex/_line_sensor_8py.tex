\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file is the Romi Robot Line Sensor class. 

The Line Sensor is a QTR-\/8\+RC Reflectance Sensor. The Class initializes required pins and creates methods required to properly utilize the encoders

The Line Sensor functionality relies on 2 nested classes. The {\ttfamily Line\+Sensor} class builds out functionality for one individual sensor, where the {\ttfamily Line\+Sensor\+Array} class combines 8 Line\+Sensor objects to create functionality as a singular object. For the {\ttfamily Line\+Sensor} class, the {\ttfamily update\+\_\+value} method is used to trigger the sensor to take a reading. The {\ttfamily get\+\_\+value} method returns the most recent reading. The {\ttfamily Line\+Sensor\+Array} class uses the {\ttfamily update\+\_\+line\+\_\+position} method to return a value between -\/1 and 1 which represents the position of a line along the array, zero being centered. In order to do this, readings are linearized and have thresholds applied based on testing done. The {\ttfamily get\+\_\+line\+\_\+position} method returns this value.
