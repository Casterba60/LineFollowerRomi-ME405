\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file is the Romi Robot motor controller, implementing a PI controller based on the output from the built in encoders. 

the {\ttfamily run} function is the main component of the controller class, which takes readings from the encoder as well as time passed to calculate proportional and integral error over time. These errors are multiplied by their respective gains to get the output for motor duty cycle. the {\ttfamily set\+Speed} function allows the alteration of the desired speed from which error is calculated. ~\newline
