\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file is the class for the BNO055 IMU sensor, it instantiates the required pins as well as the I2C bus required for commmunication. 

The BNO055 IMU provides access to Euler Angles, Heading, Quaternion, and Euler Rates. It is communicated with through an I2C bus. The {\ttfamily write\+\_\+byte} and {\ttfamily read\+\_\+byte} methods facilitate this communication, which the higher level methods use these to read and write calibration values use. The mode determines the functionality of the sensor, and is set through the @\+\_\+set\+\_\+mode method.
