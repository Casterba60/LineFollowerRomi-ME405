\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file is the finite state machine used to drive the Romi robot for line following, obstacle avoidance, and return to home objectives. 

The state machine was implemented as a class to allow its primary method, {\ttfamily FSM}, to operate with access to all the required objects. The first state is nitialization, which allows for all objects to finish their own initialization. State 0 transitions to state 1 after 1 loop. State 1 is the idle state, here Romi will wait for a push of the onboard blue button to begin running its course. The transition to state 2 occurs when the button is pushed. State 2 is the line following algorithm. It takes the output of the {\ttfamily Line\+Sensor\+Array} object and multiplies it by a set gain, and then drives the motors via the controller to stay lined up with the line. Upon a collision, which the program is constantly checking for in state 2, the state transitions to state 3. State 3 is the obstacle avoidance state, which drives a set trajectory to navigate around the box. The robot stays on this trajectory by both tracking position with encoder position as well as aligning and tracking heading change with the IMU. With the last straight line driven by state 3, the program checks for a line detection, which triggers the program to shift back to state 2. State 2, knowing it has already passed the obstacle, now searches for the perpendicular black line which will be the beginning to the finish line box. This then triggers the transition to state 4, which is return to home. This state knows the initial heading, gathered in the beginning of the program, as well as the distance back to the start box. With these two pieces of information the robot returns to the start box and upon returning, it transitions back to state 1 (idle).
