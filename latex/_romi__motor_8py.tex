\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file is the Romi motor class, initializing required pins and creating methods required to properly drive the motors. 

The motors are controlleed via 3 pins, effort, enable, and direction. The effort pin drives the speed of the motor, and takes a PWM input. The enable pin turns the motor on and off. The direction pin takes a digital signal and controls the direction of the motor. The {\ttfamily set\+\_\+duty} method inputs the PWM signal for the effort pin and the sign drives the DIR pin. {\ttfamily enable} and {\ttfamily disable} control the control the enable pin.
